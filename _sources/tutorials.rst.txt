Short Tutorials
================

This section presents some short tutorials describing the functionality of the
:py:mod:`genipe` module. The first one describes the genome-wide imputation
pipeline itself. The other tutorials describe provided tools to perform
statistical analysis or data management.

.. _genipe-tut:

Pipeline tutorial
------------------

This tutorial is a walk-through the main objective of this module, which is the
genome-wide imputation of genotypes. It describes in detail the expected input
and output files.

.. _mixedlm-tut:

Linear mixed effects tutorial
------------------------------

This tutorial is a walk-through of a linear mixed effects analysis for repeated
measurements. It describes in detail the expected input and output files.

.. _cox-tut:

Survival tutorial
------------------

This tutorial is a walk-through of a typical survival analysis (using Cox's
proportional hazard model). It describes in detail the expected input and
output files.

SKAT tutorial
--------------

This tutorial is a walk-through of a typical SKAT analysis and describes the
expected input and output files.

.. _linear-tut:

Linear tutorial
----------------

This tutorial is a walk-through of a linear regression analysis (using
ordinary least squares). It describes in detail the expected input and output
files.

.. _logistic-tut:

Logistic tutorial
------------------

This tutorial is a walk-through of a logistic regression analysis (using a GLM
with a binomial distribution and a logit link). It describes in detail the
expected input and output file.

.. _extraction-tut:

Site extraction tutorial
-------------------------

This tutorial is a walk-through of the tool used to extract sites from
imputation files. It describes in detail the expected input and output file.
