Short Tutorials
================

This section presents some short tutorials describing the functionality of the
:py:mod:`genip` module. The first one describes the genome-wide imputation
pipeline itself. The other tutorials describe provided tools to perform
statistical analysis or data management.

.. _genip-tut:

Pipeline tutorial
------------------

This tutorial walks through the main objective of this module, which is the
genome-wide imputation of genotypes. It describes in detail the expected input
and output files.

.. _cox-tut:

Survival tutorial
------------------

This tutorial walks through a full example of a survival regression (using
Cox's proportional hazard model). It describes in detail the expected input and
output files.

.. _linear-tut:

Linear tutorial
----------------

This tutorial walks through a full example of a linear regression analysis
(using ordinary least squares). It describes in detail the expected input and
output files.

.. _logistic-tut:

Logistic tutorial
------------------

This tutorial walks through a full example of a logistic regression analysis
(using a GLM with a binomial distribution and a logit link). It describes in
detail the expected input and output file.

from imputation files. It describes in detail the expected input and output
file.
