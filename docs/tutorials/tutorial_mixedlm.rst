Linear mixed effects model
---------------------------

Linear mixed effects models are commonly used for regression analyses involving
repeated measurements made on each subject (*i.e* dependent data). It is
possible to perform such an analysis using imputation data (dosage format),
where each imputed genotypes varies between 0 and 2 (inclusively). A value
close to 0 means that a homozygous genotype of the most frequent allele is the
most probable. A value close to 2 means that a homozygous genotype of the rare
allele is the most probable. Finally, a value close to 1 means that a
heterozygous genotype is the most probable.

We suppose that you have followed the main :ref:`genip-tut-page`. The following
command will create the working directory for this tutorial.

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir -p $HOME/genip_tutorial/mixedlm


.. _mixedlm-tut-input-files:

Input files
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Imputed genotypes
""""""""""""""""""

After running the :py:mod:`genip` pipeline, the imputed genotypes files will
have the ``.impute2`` or ``.impute2.gz`` extension Those files will be located
in the ``final_impute2`` directories of each chromosomes. There should be one
*impute2* file per chromosome (see the
:ref:`genip-tut-output-files-final_impute2` section in the main
:ref:`genip-tut-page`). These files consist of the imputed genotypes required
to perform the analysis.

The general structure of the file contains the following columns (which are
space delimited): the chromosome, the name of the marker, its position and its
two alleles. The subsequent columns correspond to the probabilities of each
genotype (hence, there are three columns per sample). The first value
correspond to the probability of being homozygous of the first allele. The
second value correspond to the probability of being heterozygous. Finally, the
third value correspond to the probability of being homozygous of the second
allele. The following example shows two lines of the *impute2* file.

.. code-block:: text

    21 rs376366718:10000302:A:G 10000302 A G 0.986 0.014 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 ...
    21 21:10002805:C:T 10002805 C T 0.254 0.736 0.010 0.810 0.188 0.002 0.800 0.195 0.005 ...


Samples file
"""""""""""""

This file is generated by :py:mod:`genip` and has the ``.sample`` extension.
There should be one sample file per chromosome (see the
:ref:`genip-tut-output-files-final_impute2` section in the main
:ref:`genip-tut-page`). These files greatly resembles the *Plink* ``fam`` file.
Specifically, it contains the samples that are included in the *impute2* file
(with **the same order**). It is needed to correctly interpret the sample
described by the *impute2* file. The format is as follow:

.. code-block:: text

   ID_1 ID_2 missing father mother sex plink_pheno
   0 0 0 D D D B
   1341 NA06985 0 0 0 2 -9
   1341 NA06991 0 NA06993 NA06985 2 -9
   1341 NA06993 0 0 0 1 -9
   ...

The first two rows are part of the format and should be as is.

.. warning::

   The column ``ID_2`` should contain **unique** sample identification numbers,
   since the analysis will only consider the ``ID_2`` (which correspond to the
   sample ID in the *Plink* file) to correctly match the samples and the
   imputed genotypes.


Phenotype file
"""""""""""""""

This file describes the phenotype and variables used to perform the analysis.
The file is *tab* separated and contains one row per sample, one column per
phenotype/variable.

The following is an example of a phenotype file (where there are three
measurements per sample):

.. code-block:: text

   SampleID	Pheno3	Age	Var1	Gender
   NA06985	58.6923101992	53	48.01043142060001	2
   NA06985	79.18026839086532	53	48.01043142060001	2
   NA06985	97.6831921953767	53	48.01043142060001	2
   NA06993	64.8981628053	47	23.7615117523	1
   NA06993	81.26389783395985	47	23.7615117523	1
   NA06993	100.71531297841553	47	23.7615117523	1
   NA06994	129.562482664	48	20.2946857226	1
   NA06994	144.2513248255908	48	20.2946857226	1
   NA06994	161.94488318622535	48	20.2946857226	1
   ...

We provide a *dummy* phenotype file (where values, except for ``Gender``, were
randomly generated for 60 founders of the dataset). The following command
should download the phenotype file.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd $HOME/genip_tutorial/mixedlm

   wget http://pgxcentre.github.io/genip/_static/tutorial/phenotypes_mixedlm.txt.bz2
   bunzip2 phenotypes_mixedlm.txt.bz2 

.. note::

   Note that the gender is encoded such that males are ``1`` and females are
   ``2``. Samples with missing gender (encoded as ``0``) will be excluded only
   if gender is in the covariable list.

.. note::

   Categorical variables should be specified using the ``--categorical``
   option.

.. warning::

   The sample identification numbers should match the ones in the sample file
   (see above). Those numbers should be unique for each sample. There should be
   multiple rows for each sample, one for each repeated measurement. Only the
   samples that are **both** in the sample and phenotype files will be kept for
   analysis. The order of the samples in the phenotype file is not important.


Sites to extract (optional)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This file (which is optional) should contain a list of site (one identification
number per line) to keep for the analysis. This file might be the
``.good_sites`` file automatically generated by :py:mod:`genip` (see the
:ref:`genip-tut-output-files-final_impute2` section in the main
:ref:`genip-tut-page`).


.. _mixedlm-tut-execute:

Executing the analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you followed the :ref:`genip-tut-page`, the following commands should
execute the linear mixed effects analysis.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd $HOME/genip_tutorial/mixedlm

   imputed-stats mixedlm \
       --impute2 ../genip/chr22/final_impute2/chr22.imputed.impute2.gz \
       --sample ../genip/chr22/final_impute2/chr22.imputed.sample \
       --pheno phenotypes_mixedlm.txt \
       --extract-sites ../genip/chr22/final_impute2/chr22.imputed.good_sites \
       --nb-process 8 \
       --nb-lines 6000 \
       --gender-column Gender \
       --covar Age,Var1,Gender \
       --sample-column SampleID \
       --pheno-name Pheno3

For more information about the arguments and options, see the
:ref:`lin-tut-usage` section. The number of process to use might differ
according to the installation type and to the computer/server. See the
:ref:`lin-tut-execution-time` section for more information.

.. note::

   Analysis will be performed only on samples whitout missing data (phenotype,
   gender, variables, etc).

   By default, the analysis is performed by removing low quality genotypes
   (using a probability threshold of 0.9, the ``--prob`` option).


.. _mixedlm-tut-output-files:

Output files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There will be two output files: ``.mixedlm.dosage`` will contain the
statistics, and ``.log`` will contain the execution log.


``.mixedlm.dosage`` file
""""""""""""""""""""""""

This file contains the results from the linear mixed effects analysis. It shows
the following information:

* ``chr``: the chromosome.
* ``pos``: the position on the chromosome.
* ``snp``: the name of the marker.
* ``major``: the major allele.
* ``minor``: the minor allele.
* ``maf``: the frequency of the minor allele.
* ``n``: the number of samples that were used for this marker.
* ``coef``: the coefficient.
* ``se``: the standard error.
* ``lower``: the lower value of the 95% confidence interval.
* ``upper``: the upper value of the 95% confidence interval.
* ``z``: the *z*-statistic.
* ``p``: the *p*-value.

.. note::

   By default, the statistics are computed only for markers with a minor allele
   frequency of 1% and higher. Markers with lower MAF will have ``NA`` values.
   To modify this behavior, use the ``--maf`` option.


.. _mixedlm-tut-usage:

.. _mixedlm-tut-execution-time:

Execution time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following figure shows the approximate execution time for different number
of processes (the ``--nb-process`` option) with different installation methods
(*pyvenv* in blue, versus *miniconda* in orange). This analysis was performed
on a computer with an *Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz* (8 cores) and
16Go of RAM. The analysis contained the 195,473 imputed markers and 90 samples
from the previous command (where phenotypes were available for only 60 of the
samples). Each test was performed only one time (no repetition).

.. _mixedlm-tut-comparison:

Results comparison
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The linear mixed effects analysis results from :py:mod:`genip` and *R* were
compared for validity. The following figure shows the comparison for, from left
to right, the coefficients, the standard errors and the *p*-values. The *x*
axis shows the results from :py:mod:`genip`, and the *y* axis shows the results
for *R*. This comparison includes 163,670 "good" imputed markers, analyzed for
60 samples (*i.e* results from this tutorial). Note that for this comparison,
the **probability threshold** (``--prob``) **was changed from 0.9 to 0** to
*imitate* *R* analysis (see note below for more information).

.. figure:: ../_static/images/MixedLM_Diff_Prob0.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Linear mixed effects comparison between genip and R (probability of 0)

.. note::

   The sign of the coefficients might be different when comparing
   :py:mod:`genip` to *R*, since :py:mod:`genip` computes the statistics on the
   rare allele, while *R* computes them on the second (alternative) allele. The
   alternative allele might not always be the rarest.

.. note::

   By default, :py:mod:`genip` excludes samples with a maximum probability
   lower than 0.9 (the ``--prob`` option), while *R* keeps all the samples for
   the analysis. In order to get the same results as *R*, the analysis must be
   done with a probability threshold of 0 (*i.e.* ``--prob 0``, keeping all
   imputed genotypes including those with poor quality). This is what was done
   for the previous figure.

   The following figure shows the comparison between *R* and :py:mod:`genip`
   for the same analysis, but using the default probability threshold of 0.9
   (excluding imputed genotypes with poor quality). Hence, 163,670 markers were
   compared.
